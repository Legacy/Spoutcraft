## What is Spoutcraft?
Spoutcraft is a modified Minecraft client, which is accessible via the Spoutcraft Launcher, that boosts increased FPS, HD textures/fonts, minimap, and an overview map. When connecting to a server with SpoutPlugin, custom blocks and items, custom guis, custom sounds, etc are all available for use. Spoutcraft is a legacy project and will be replaced by the Spout client when finished.
